/* 
  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing 
  the desired pwms pin to the attach() method.
  The servos are pulsed using pwms the value most recently
  written using the write() method.

  The methods are:

    Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.

    attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
    attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
    default min is 544, max is 2400  
 
    write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
    writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds 
    read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
    readMicroseconds()   - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
    attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
    detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
